# Web Crawler with Sentiment Analysis

**Note: This is the very beginning of a mini search engine with sentiment analysis**<br />
**The first version of crawler.py has been added, which crawls of a web page, searches for links and returns them. Please note it'll only get links that start with <a href=* **
